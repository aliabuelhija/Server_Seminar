To ensure the successful storage of your data in the database, follow these steps:

1. Begin by initiating a request using Postman, a versatile API development tool. Use the HTTP POST method and target the URL "/superapp/countries/save". This endpoint is responsible for handling the data-saving process.

```http
POST /superapp/countries/save
```

2. Upon sending the request, the server will process the data and persist it in the database. Once the data is safely stored, you can proceed to utilize other services provided by the server. This ensures that your data is securely saved and readily available for further operations.

By adhering to these steps, you can confidently save your data to the database and seamlessly leverage additional server functionalities as needed.
